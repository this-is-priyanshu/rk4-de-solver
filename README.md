# Differential Equation Solver using RK4 method
This web-based project implements the Runge-Kutta 4th Order (RK4) method for solving 1st order and 2nd order ordinary differential equations.
### Features
- Supports both 1st order and 2nd order differential equations
- Displays computational values in the form of a table
- Visualization of the solution using a 3-D graph
### Technologies Used
- **HTML, CSS**: For the web interface
- **JavaScript**: For implementing the numerical methods
- **Plotly.js**: For 3-D graph plotting
###### Note: It is recommended to open this project on a computer, as the interface may get distorted on a smartphone/tablet screen.
